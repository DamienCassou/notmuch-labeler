Emacs notmuch-labeler
==========

notmuch-labeler improves notmuch way of displaying labels through
fonts, pictures, and hyperlinks.

By default notmuch presents email labels as plain text. This
package improves notmuch by lettings users choose how to present
each label (e.g., with a special font, with a picture, ...).
Additionally, this package transforms each label into an hyperlink
to show all emails with this label.
